## CHIPLESS
A Bet Manager for Texas Hold'em Poker

This is a tool for Texas Hold'em Poker that is used for managing bets within in-person games. This means you play with real cards but you use the app on someone's phone that can be passed around the table and used for placing bets and distributing winnings etc.

This is still a WIP and only unfinished versions, that lack core functionality, are available as of current.
